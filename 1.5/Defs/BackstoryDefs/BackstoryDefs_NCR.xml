While [PAWN_pronoun] was not quite as unscrupulous as [PAWN_possessive] employers, [PAWN_pronoun] was still willing to take care of many tasks other, more moral people wouldn’t have dared to do.</description>

The skills [PAWN_nameDef] learned during [PAWN_possessive] time with the enclave came in handy with many of the jobs [PAWN_pronoun] took over the years.</description>
