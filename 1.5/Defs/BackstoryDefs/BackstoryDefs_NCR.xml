		<description>While most people appreciated the services and protection the NCR offered to its citizens, the taxes that were levied to pay for these things were considerably less popular. The people who came to collect these taxes in the name of the Californian government were equally undesired, but [PAWN_nameDef] took pride in [PAWN_possessive] work anyway. [PAWN_pronoun] wasn’t exactly a fighter and relied on either words or an armed escort to deal with those unwilling to pay their share, as well as with those few ne'er-do-wells who were brave or foolish enough to try stealing [PAWN_possessive] coffers.</description>
