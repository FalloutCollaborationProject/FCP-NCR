		<description>While the Van Graff family tried to appear as legitimate businesspeople, they rather resembled a crime syndicate. [PAWN_nameDef] worked as a thug for the Van Graffs for quite some time and received extensive training with energy weapons, of which the Van Graff family was a major distributor. While [PAWN_pronoun] was not quite as unscrupulous as [PAWN_possessive] employers, [PAWN_pronoun] was still willing to take care of many tasks other, more moral people wouldn’t have dared to do.</description>

		<description>Until the sacking of Navarro at the hands of the NCR military, [PAWN_nameDef] was a member of the Enclave. [PAWN_pronoun] was one of the few survivors of that battle. Separated from [PAWN_possessive] former comrades, [PAWN_nameDef] decided to lay low to escape the wrath of the NCR, taking work wherever [PAWN_pronoun] could find it and never staying long at one location. The skills [PAWN_nameDef] learned during [PAWN_possessive] time with the enclave came in handy with many of the jobs [PAWN_pronoun] took over the years.</description>

		<description>The Brotherhood doesn’t take prisoners. When [PAWN_nameDef] led a patrol into contested NCR territory, the mission was supposed to be a simple scouting operation. Instead, it turned into a massacre. [PAWN_pronoun] barely escaped, while [PAWN_possessive] entire unit was wiped out by a single squad of Brotherhood Knights. The NCR may have won the war against them, but [PAWN_pronoun] knows better, the Brotherhood isn’t gone, just hiding, waiting to strike again. And [PAWN_pronoun] will be waiting too.</description>

When [PAWN_pronoun] signed up with the NCR, [PAWN_possessive] dreams were of clean clinics, careful surgeries, and patients who had a real chance at survival. Instead, [PAWN_pronoun] spent [PAWN_possessive] career digging bullets out of screaming soldiers, using whatever tools were on hand to keep them alive for just one more fight. The Republic’s wars never end, and neither does [PAWN_possessive] work.</description>

Many of [PAWN_possessive] fellow officers call [PAWN_pronoun] soft, but [PAWN_pronoun] believes that if the Republic truly stands for something, it should be compassion.</description>

Eventually, the NCR made [PAWN_pronoun] an offer, regular supplies, security, and a real place to work. It wasn’t a hard choice. But even now, [PAWN_pronoun] sometimes wonders if the Republic is really any different from the warlords [PAWN_pronoun] used to avoid.</description>

		<description>As a child [PAWN_nameDef] survived the massacre at Bitter Springs, unlike [PAWN_possessive] friends and family. [PAWN_pronoun] was first taken into custody and later adopted by NCR citizens who, much like most of the NCR military, avoided talking with [PAWN_objective] about this dark chapter in the republic’s history. Instead, [PAWN_nameDef] learned to express [PAWN_objective]self artistically to cope with [PAWN_possessive] trauma.</description>

		<description>[PAWN_nameDef] was born into a raider gang, which had its territories within the NCR. During the NCR-Raider-War, in which most raider groups in the republic were either wiped out or driven out, [PAWN_pronoun] was captured. The republic put much effort into the re-education of [PAWN_nameDef], but [PAWN_pronoun] never managed to shed all [PAWN_pronoun] had learned as a raider and remained somewhat untamed and savage.</description>
